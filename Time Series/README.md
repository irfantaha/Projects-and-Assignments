# Time Series Data Analysis

## Lake Huron Water Level (1875-1972)

The dataset gives the annual water level of Lake Huron. As such, the series does not exhibit any seasonality as intra-year seasonalities such as the four seasons and glacier melt is not taken into consideration. The data seems to follow a downward trend up to roughly the year 1930. Afterwards, the downward trend disappeared.

Upon further research, it is interesting to note that the low water levels in the **1930s & 1960s** are caused by a reduced precipitation during the winter months, exacerbated by higher temperatures in summer, leading to increased evaporation. This is further proof of cyclicality which is confirmed by modern data showing lows again in 1998/99. (https://www.michigan.gov/egle/0,9429,7-135-3313_3677_3704-12566--,00.html)
